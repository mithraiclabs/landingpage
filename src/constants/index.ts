checks-and-balances of the DAO. This allows PSY holders to create incentives to reward participation and drive usage of the
protocol. Anybody with 0.1% of the PSY token delegated to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or
complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor, changing a market’s
interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol that the current administrator can modify.
Proposals are executable code, not suggestions for a team or foundation to implement. They are not limited to the governance
protocol itself, but extend to all protocols created by the PsyOptionsDAO including the American v1 and European v1
protocols contributed by the creators at launch. All proposals are subject to a 3 day voting period, and any address with
PSY delegated can vote for or against the proposal. If a majority, and at least 2% of the PSY token supply are cast for the
proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.`
